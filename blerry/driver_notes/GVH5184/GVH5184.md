Working notes - reverse engineering data stream for GVH5184


Working on the code for the 4-probe Govee driver.  NOTE - any code is intended as psuedo-code and is not syntax correct.

The full 'p' string that comes from BLE looks like this:

0201060303518414FF363E5D01000101E40106FFFFFFFF06FFFFFFFF

Breaking that down: (ref - https://community.silabs.com/s/article/kba-bt-0201-bluetooth-advertising-data-basics?language=en_US)

```
02 01 06    03 03 51 84    14 FF


02 01 06 
-- -- -- <- Two bytes (02), Type = Flags (01), Value (06) (bitwise -  00000110) Bit 1 : “LE General Discoverable Mode”
                                                                                Bit 2: “BR/EDR Not Supported.”

03 03 51 84
-- -- -- -- <- Three bytes (03), Type = Service Class (03), Little endian.  84 51 - not in the list of 16Bit UUIDs.  Perhaps Manuf cheated and just put model number here instead.  It is the 5184 sensor.

14 FF
-- -- <- 20 Bytes (0x14), Type = FF - Manuf. Proprietary data
This is what we were looking for.  All data after the 14 FF will be data we can break up for sensor data.
```

The remaining string to be manipulated:

36 3E 5D 01 00 01 01 E4 01 06 FF FF FF FF 06 FF FF FF FF

```

                            -- <- Probe1/3 status.  06 is no probe.  86 is probe inserted.  C6 when probe has exceeded setpoint

                               -- -- <- Probe1/3 temp.  FF FF if not inserted.  Big-endian 2-byte number.  See below.

                                           15
                                           06
                                           -- <- Probe2/4 status. 06 is no probe.  86 is probe inserted.

                                              16 17  
                                              FF FF
                                              -- -- <- Probe2/4 temp.  Same scheme as Probe 1/3

                                                    18 19

                                                    -- -- <- Probe2/4 set point for alarm. Same scheme as temp.
```

We now can build out a sensor data stream to encode and push back through MQTT

```
BYTE8 - Battery %. 0x00-0xFF, 0-255 - Battery percentage is (VALUE / 255)
BYTE9 - Sequence.  Either 01 or 02.  01 represents Probes 1 & 2.  02 represents probes 3 & 4.
BYTE10 - Probe[A] Status.  [A] is 1 when Sequence is 1. [A] is 3 when Sequence is 2.
          Possible Values.  06 - no probe inserted.   86 - Probe inserted normal function.  C6 - probe temp has exceeded set point.
BYTE11-12 - Probe[A] Temp.  Two bytes - big endian - convert to decimal and divide by 100 to obtain temperature in (C).
BYTE13-14 - Probe[A] Setpoint.  Two bytes - big endian.  Same conversion.  Temp to alarm at.  Will set status to C6 when temp >= setpoint
BYTE15 - Probe[B] Status.  [A] is 1 when Sequence is 1. [A] is 3 when Sequence is 2.
          Possible Values.  06 - no probe inserted.   86 - Probe inserted normal function.  C6 - probe temp has exceeded set point.
BYTE16-17 - Probe[B] Temp.  Two bytes - big endian - convert to decimal and divide by 100 to obtain temperature in (C).
BYTE18-19 - Probe[B] Setpoint.  Two bytes - big endian.  Same conversion.  Temp to alarm at.  Will set status to C6 when temp >= setpoint
```



Building on other driver files, the following approach will be used.

## NOTE - there are decoded bits in the Status byte that are not used currently in this driver.  See Step 5

1) Unlike v0.15 - V0.2 has much of the work of tracking changes done in the main file.  Therefore we no longer need to tract current state and last state within the driver.  This immensely simplifies the driver approach.

2) There are a total of 4 probes with a probe number being the only change between them.  Create probe labels __1__ & __2__ and then when check to see if the sequence (in the 8th byte) is equal to bank 2, update to 3 & 4.

3) Battery value is the same for both banks so we can set it right away
4) Each bank has two probes.  The second bank is 5 bytes further down than the absolute byte positions of bank one.  Create and offset value that is our loop value (0 or 1) multiplied by 5 - resulting in an offset of either 0 or 5.  Add the offset to the absolute byte positions for the various data.
5) For Probe A (first probe in either bank) - the absolute positions are
  Status & Alarm Byte - Byte 9 (where byte 0 is the first in the series) - we need to unpack these bits
     Status bit is the MSB - Bit 7.  1 is probe inserted.  0 is no probe (MSB is Bit 7, LSB is bit 0)
     Alarm bit is bit 6 - 1 is alarming.  0 is normal
     We use the helper function "bitval" to obtain the bit value from the byte.  Note bits 0-3 contain the code for the meat preset.  
     See the end of this file for the chart if additional functionality is desired.  Currently not implemented
  Probe Temp is byte 10
  Probe Setpoint Temp is byte 12
6) For the temp sensors we created an internal helper function f_t to determine if the temp is a default value of FFFF and set the status to
   'unavailable' otherwise we obtain the temp in C by dividing the 0Xaabb value by 100.  Result is DegC in decimal.
7) On second loop of our FOR loop, offset will be 5.  Probe Status Byte - 14, Probe Temp - 15, Probe Setpoint - 17
8) This device does not need active scan; therefore, blerry_active is set to false. 


### Probe Status Bits 0-3 - decoded to meat preset
When an alarm is set to a preset value - the preset type (eg beef or veal) is sent back in the status byte.  If a custom temperature is desired, DIY is selected in the app.  If no preset and no alarm is desired, hitting clear in the preset area will result in that status.  Cleared will result in FFFF being sent in the Setpoint as well.

These could be used as a modification if someone wanted an entity that showed the preset name or even more ambitious - the icon used in the app.

```
Beef    = 0b0000 = 0x0 = 0 (row 1, entry 1)
Veal    = 0b0111 = 0x7 = 7 (row 1, entry 2)
Lamb    = 0b0001 = 0x1 = 1 (row 1, entry 3)
Pork    = 0b0010 = 0x2 = 2 (row 1, entry 4)
Poultry = 0b0011 = 0x3 = 3 (row 1, entry 5)
Turkey  = 0b0100 = 0x4 = 4 (row 2, entry 1)
Fish    = 0b0101 = 0x5 = 5 (row 2, entry 2)
Sausage = 0b1000 = 0x8 = 8 (row 2, entry 3)
Ham     = 0b1001 = 0x9 = 9 (row 2, entry 4)
Shrimp  = 0b1010 = 0xA = 10(row 2, entry 5)
Potato  = 0b1011 = 0xB = 11(row 3, entry 1)
Cupcake = 0b1100 = 0xC = 12(row 3, entry 2)
Egg Dish= 0b1101 = 0xD = 13(row 3, entry 3)
DIY     = 0b0110 = 0x6 = 6 (row 3, entry 4)
CLEARED = 0b1111 = 0xF = 15 (Hit clear button)
```
